After you have read the :ref:`quickstart` you can now head into the special
configuration. This chapter is split into four sections. :ref:`views` are the
center of configuration. Here you define which form to use, how templates
are located and under which route it should be available. Views also needs
:ref:`forms`. These define the associated model and configure which fields are
displayed. Finally, if the default templates don't suit you (e.g. you want to
integrate your own style or you don't use Mako), you can visit the
:ref:`templates` section to see how to change the default templates.

There are also some :ref:`examples` that show possible applications. You can
refer there to see how your goal can be realized in pratice.
